                <br>It shows the time difference of correct answer submission between you and the 1st participant to complete that level. For example, if your split time is +0:10:13.0000, you were 10 minutes and 13 seconds late in submitting the correct answer to your previous level as compared to the 1st participant completing that same level. If your split time is +0:0:0.0000, you were the first one to submit the correct answer to your previous level.

            <li class = "my-1">Only one prize will be awarded:
                <br>a) The prize will go to the first player completing all the levels irrespective of points and split time.
                <br>b) If no one is able to complete all the levels and the event ends, the player with maximum level will win. If levels are same then points will be considered and if points are same then split time will be considered in deciding the winner.
